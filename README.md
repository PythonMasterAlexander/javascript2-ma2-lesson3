Lesson Task 3 Question

Use an input box and button to add new objects to an array callled todos.

Create an HTML list by looping over the array.

Each object should have three properties: id, name and isComplete.

The name property should be displayed in a textbox and be updateable on the keyup event.

Each item should include a checkbox that toggles the isComplete property between true and false.

If the isComplete property is true the whole item should be displayed at 50% opacity.
